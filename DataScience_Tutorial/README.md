# CMSC320: Data Science Tutorial Project

# Installing the datasets
In this tutorial, we use several datasets.  The first is an energy dataset, which can be found at data.gov, and the other two are temperature datasets, maintained by the University of Califorinia, Berkeley.


To install the first energy dataset, go to https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/monthly-energy-consumption-by-sector, and click on the "Download" button.  The file will download an excel spreadsheet of energy data.
